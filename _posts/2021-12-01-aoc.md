Happy December! When many people think of December, they think of Christmas, festive decorations going up, cold weather approaching (_if you're in the Northern Hemisphere_), and more. While I am certainly one of these people, one more thing comes to mind for me that others may not think of. This post, I am going to introduce you to Advent of Code. Let's get into it!

So what is Advent of Code? Sometimes referred to as AoC, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an event put together by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) where anyone can challenge themselves to two new coding problems a day, running from the 1st of December to the 25th of December. It models that of a traditional Advent calendar, which is where it derives its name from. Imagine festive LeetCode that rewards you with a picture when you're done, and you've got AoC. People use Advent of Code to either learn a new programming lanugage, race with friends, or just keep their problem solving skills sharp. Last year, I participated just a little bit, and this year, I want to make it to the end.

As you may have inferred from my [last post](https://jekyll-blog-gilt.vercel.app/2021/11/27/first-post.html), I am working mainly in Rust in my free time, and this endeavor is no exception. If you want to track my progress and see my solutions, I suggest you watch my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zachschickler/advent-of-code-2021). But fair warning, I typically upload the problems pretty fast, so if you're trying the problems yourself don't peek too far in! I hope you try it out yourself, as it is genuinely a fun event to participate in and a great learning opportunity. If you've decided to give it a try, I wish you the best of luck and happy holidays!

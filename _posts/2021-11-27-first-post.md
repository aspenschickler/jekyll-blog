Howdy and welcome to my blog for all things related to software development and games. This blog will serve as a place to provide the internet with helpful guides sharing what I've learned in my programming experience as well as updates on projects I'm currently on. If any of what I described interests you, I would suggest keeping an eye out for new posts.

To give you a basic roadmap, my next upcoming project is a programming language built in Rust with syntax similar to Lua. I plan to release standard libraries for the language after its release. Once that goes public, I'll scale down my work on it to resume work on a game I've been developing using the LÃ–VE framework. After that's published on my [itch.io](https://aspenmakesgames.itch.io/), who knows.

> Keep in mind, I am finishing college and transitioning to a job at this time, so please take that into consideration when calculating this vague timeline of progress in your head. ðŸ˜µ

If you want to learn more about me, consider visiting my personal website [here](https://zachschickler.com/). I hope to see you again. Until next time!
